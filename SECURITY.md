# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a reference repository for learning and experimentation. We do not provide formal support or security patches for specific versions. Use at your own risk in lab environments.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in the configurations or examples here (e.g. default credentials, insecure settings, exposed secrets), please report it:

1. **Open an issue** – Describe the concern and where it occurs (file, stack, or manifest).
2. **Do not** include exploits or sensitive details in public issues.

For urgent matters, you can reach out privately through GitHub if you have that option enabled.

## General Notes

- **No production use** – These configs are intentionally generic and sanitized. They are not production-ready without proper hardening, secrets management, and tuning.
- **Change defaults** – Replace placeholder passwords, tokens, and emails before deploying.
- **Network isolation** – Run lab stacks in isolated networks when possible.
